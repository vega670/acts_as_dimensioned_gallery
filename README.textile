h1. ActsAsDimensionedGallery

p. ActsAsDimensionedGallery is a Ruby on Rails plugin allowing developers to add an image gallery to any model in an existing project. The plugin allows image dimensions to be created, edited, or destroyed at any time and will retroactively apply all dimensions to previously uploaded images as well as all new images. Dimensions can be managed as gallery-specific or independently and existing dimensions can be added to any gallery.

h3. *WARNING:* ActsAsDimensionedGallery currently has very basic views and has not been extensively tested. Use with caution.

h2. Usage

Follow these steps to install and configure the plugin:

1. Run the dimensioned_gallery migration to create the needed database tables.

@rake db:migrate:dimensioned_gallery@

p. 2. In all models you want to add galleries to, call @acts_as_dimensioned_gallery@.

When creating links in pages rendered by controllers in the plugin app, the default behavior is to create polymorphic routes. To disable this, include: @:automatic_polymorphic_routes => :false@ after @acts_as_dimensioned_gallery@

3. Run @rake dimensioned_gallery:initialize@ to create the necessary directories.

4. If you have not already, install the Image Magick application ( http://www.imagemagick.org/ ). In config/environment.rb, add @IMAGE_MAGICK_PATH = "/path/to/image/magick"@ (the path will usually be @/usr/bin@ on Linux or something like @C:\Program Files\ImageMagick@ on Windows).

5. If you would like to require a user to sign in before using the administrative functions,
define @AADG_AUTHENTICATE@ as the function you would like the plugin to call before allowing
access to administrative functions.

6. Add the following to the resources you would like to add galleries to in routes.rb:

bc.. resources :myresource do
  resources :galleries do
    resources :images
  end

  namespace(:aadgadmin, :namespace => '') do
    resources :galleries do
      resources :dimensions
      resources :images
    end
    resources :dimensions do
      resources :galleries
    end
  end
end

namespace :aadgadmin do
  resources :dimensions do
    resources :galleries
  end
end

h2. Example for resource "Item":

h3. Item.rb

bc. class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_dimensioned_gallery
end


h3. config/environment.rb

add:

bc.. IMAGE_MAGICK_PATH = "/usr/bin"
AADG_AUTHENTICATE = :authenticate_user!

h3. config/routes.rb

add:

bc.. resources :items do
  resources :galleries do
    resources :images
  end

  namespace(:aadgadmin, :namespace => '') do
    resources :galleries do
      resources :dimensions
      resources :images
    end
    resources :dimensions do
      resources :galleries
    end
  end
end

namespace :aadgadmin do
  resources :dimensions do
    resources :galleries
  end
end
