ActsAsDimensionedGallery
========================

ActsAsDimensionedGallery is a Ruby on Rails plugin allowing developers to add
an image gallery to any model in an existing project.
The plugin allows image dimensions to be created, edited, or destroyed at any
time and will retroactively apply all dimensions to previously uploaded images
as well as all new images. Dimensions can be managed as gallery-specific or
independently and existing dimensions can be added to any gallery.
