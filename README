ActsAsDimensionedGallery
========================

ActsAsDimensionedGallery is a Ruby on Rails plugin allowing developers to add
an image gallery to any model in an existing project.
The plugin allows image dimensions to be created, edited, or destroyed at any
time and will retroactively apply all dimensions to previously uploaded images
as well as all new images. Dimensions can be managed as gallery-specific or
independently and existing dimensions can be added to any gallery.

!!!WARNING!!! ActsAsDimensionedGallery currently has very basic views and has
              not been extensively tested. Use with caution.

Usage
=====

Follow these steps to install and configure the plugin:

1. Run the dimensioned_gallery migration to create the needed database tables.

rake db:migrate:dimensioned_gallery

2. In all models you want to add galleries to, call 'acts_as_dimensioned_gallery'.
  a) When creating links in pages rendered by controllers in the plugin app, the
     default behavior is to create polymorphic routes. To disable this, include
     ":automatic_polymorphic_routes => :false" after acts_as_dimensioned_gallery.

3. Add a directory named 'galleries' in the 'public' directory of
your Rails app.

4. If you have not already, install the Image Magick application
( http://www.imagemagick.org/ ). In config/environment.rb, add
'IMAGE_MAGICK_PATH = "/path/to/image/magick"' (the path will usually be
'/usr/bin' on Linux or something like 'C:\Program Files\ImageMagick' on Windows).

5. Add the following to the resources you would like to add galleries to in routes.rb:
  resources :myresource do
    resources :galleries do
      resources :images
    end

    namespace(:aadgadmin, :namespace => '') do
      resources :galleries do
        resources :dimensions
        resources :images
      end
      resources :dimensions do
        resources :galleries
      end
    end
  end

  namespace :aadgadmin do
    resources :dimensions do
      resources :galleries
    end
  end


Example for resource "Item":
==============================

## Item.rb ###################

class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_dimensioned_gallery
end

##############################


## config/environment.rb #####
add:

IMAGE_MAGICK_PATH = "/usr/bin"

##############################


## config/routes.rb ##########
add:

resources :items do
  resources :galleries do
    resources :images
  end

  namespace(:aadgadmin, :namespace => '') do
    resources :galleries do
      resources :dimensions
      resources :images
    end
    resources :dimensions do
      resources :galleries
    end
  end
end

namespace :aadgadmin do
  resources :dimensions do
    resources :galleries
  end
end
